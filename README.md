Still a WIP

Application Overview

“Who’s Playing Tonight?” is an event planning app to be used with a group of friends to communicate which concerts are happening in the area for known bands or to share newer bands (and YouTube links to music) playing in the area.  It’s based around a calendar home page that displays the events for the current month which, when clicked, allows users to get details on show information, band information, and what shows friends have been going to lately.
